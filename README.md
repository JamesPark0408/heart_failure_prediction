# heart_failure_prediction
Using given dataset, I try to predict if one has heart failure or not as accurate as possible

Algorithm used was Random Forest Algorithm. As it is able to handle the mixture of categorical and numerical values and this is a classification task. As compared to decision trees where overfitting is common, RF is able to cross validate (reduces overfitting) and improve the accuracy vastly.
