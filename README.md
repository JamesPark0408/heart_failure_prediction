# heart_failure_prediction
Using given dataset, I try to predict if one has heart failure or not as accurate as possible

Algorithm used was Random Forest Algorithm. As it is able to handle the mixture of categorical and numerical values and this is a classification task. As compared to decision trees where overfitting is common, RF is able to cross validate (reduces overfitting) and improve the accuracy vastly.

Update on 8 April:
I have realised the code needs lots of improvement. First off, my evaluation was poor. I only included the accuracy when I should include other evaluation metrics like recall and specification for example to check for each class label and how good the model is to determine heart failure or not. More visualization and analysis needed before I implement my Random Forest Algorithm. *Will work on this again*
